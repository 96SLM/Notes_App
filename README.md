Lab 5 - Notes App
Overview
Create a simple note-taking app using Android Jetpack Compose.
The app must store notes in a Room Database, toggle dark mode using DataStore,
and pass both DAO tests (CRUD) and UI tests (add, edit, delete notes + dark mode toggle).
No changes to your existing code are required, as long as it meets these specifications.
